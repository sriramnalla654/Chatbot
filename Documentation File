# Chatbot Documentation

## Overview

The Wine Chatbot project is a Flask-based web application designed to provide quick answers to customers visiting a wine-selling business's website. The chatbot responds to user queries based on a pre-defined corpus stored in a JSON file.

## Components

### Backend (Flask Application)

- **app.py**: The main Flask application file.
  - Loads the corpus from a JSON file.
  - Defines the chat endpoint to handle user messages.
  - Matches user queries with the corpus and returns appropriate responses.

### Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

- **templates/index.html**: The HTML template for the chatbot UI.
  - Contains the structure of the chat interface.
  - Includes input fields and buttons for user interaction.
  
- **static/styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the chat interface.
  - Adds styles for the chat container, messages, and input elements.
  
- **index.html (script section)**: JavaScript for handling user interactions.
  - Captures user input and sends it to the Flask backend.
  - Displays the response from the backend in the chat interface.

### Environment Configuration

- **.env**: Stores environment variables, including the OpenAI API key.
  - Example content:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

### Corpus

- **sample_question_answers.json**: The JSON file containing the corpus of question-answer pairs.
  - Example content:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "question": "What makes Jessup Cellars unique compared to other tasting rooms in Yountville?",
            "answer": "Jessup Cellars has a casual and inviting atmosphere and was the first tasting room opened in Yountville in 2003. You have the option of sitting inside our stunning art gallery or you may choose to enjoy the patio with giant umbrellas. We also have space available for private groups and special accommodations and snacks for your children. Our fine art is meticulously curated by our lead artist Jermaine Dante who exhibits his colorful creations in large formats in our spacious gallery where you can take in, or take home the inspiring art while imbibing your favorite Jessup wines."
        },
        {
